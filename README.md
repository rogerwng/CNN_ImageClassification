# Exploring CNN Models on Image Classification Tasks
PyTorch implementation of CNN architectures including LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, NiN, GoogLeNet, etc. 

Models evaluated on FashionMNIST and Imagenette (subset of Imagenet).

Many models use same boilerplate code for training loops, forward and loss methods, etc.
Larger models trained on AWS EC2 Instance (g4dn.xlarge).
